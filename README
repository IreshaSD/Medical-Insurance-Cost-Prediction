Insurance Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

# Overview

This Python script focuses on predicting insurance costs using a Linear Regression model. It loads an insurance dataset, explores its characteristics, visualizes data distributions, encodes categorical features, performs model training using Linear Regression, and evaluates the model's performance.

# Description

* The script imports necessary Python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn) for data handling, visualization, modeling, and evaluation. It reads  an insurance dataset from a CSV file, explores the dataset's structure, handles missing values, and analyzes statistical measures.

* Data visualization involves plotting age distribution using different methods (displot and distplot), visualizing sex distribution using countplot, and encoding categorical features ('sex', 'smoker', 'region') into numerical values.

* Model training using Linear Regression involves splitting the data into training and test sets, fitting the model, and evaluating it using R-squared values on both training and test data. Lastly, it demonstrates a predictive system for estimating insurance costs based on input parameters.

# Features
